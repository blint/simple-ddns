# simple-ddns
A Simple Dynamic DNS Server for Personal Usage

Too lazy to write documents... Please read `site_config.py`. 

To me it is mainly used for restarting VPN daemon in Fudan campus network when client changes his IP address.

#### Features:
- Clients request changing of certain domain via HTTPS.
- Authentication is supported.
- You can also provide a function to be executed when ip changed.


####Thanks:
Without the pushing of GFW this project won't be done.
